            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worthy SIR:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis dayes ſucceſſe, ſo far beyond Expectation hath haſtened theſe Lines, as I promiſed, to give you a ſpeedy account of our proceedings here: This morning Intelligence was brought to our Horſe quarters, that the Enemy vvas plundering about Hinckley; whereupon my noble Lord <hi>Gray</hi> being ever ready of any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſerve his country, forthwith ſent out a well reſolved party, under the command of captain <hi>Babington,</hi> conſiſting of Eighty good Horſe, they marched tovvards Boſvvorth field, where they overtook One hundred and twenty of <hi>Haſtings</hi> Forces, and there fought with them, in the very place where King <hi>Richard</hi> was ſlain: At the firſt charge the Enemy fled, our men made a hot purſuit for three miles, killed ſix, wounded many, took Forty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109866:3"/>priſoners, a Liſt whereof I have inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as truly collected as the ſhort time will permit; for I beleeve, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, there will be found a greater number of Officers then are here named, for the habits and poſtures of many of the priſoners give juſt cauſe to ſuſpect their condition to be far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove common Troopers. VVe loſt not one man; captain <hi>Babington</hi> ſhot in the hand, whoſe Behaviour I cannot paſſe; At the diſcovery of the Enemy he made a ſtand, and gave ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his Souldiers to forbear plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but to go on couragiouſly with him; and promiſed them on the word of a Gentleman, that if the day proved theirs (which he feared not with Gods aſsiſtance) what prize ſhould be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Enemy ſhould be theirs; this ſucceeded, and is performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. There was alſo wounded on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109866:4"/>our party, the quarter-Maſter to Sir <hi>Edward Hartop,</hi> he is ſhot in the thigh, and a common Souldier or two ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded. And to make our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe the greater, this was done after we had three dayes hard march, and but four hours refreſhment before this Deſigne was undertaken (our Forces being called back from their march to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> upon Intelligence of the Enemies Deſign to plunder our country.)</p>
            <p>VVe attribute all to the giver of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories: I pray you let us hear what good News the VVeſt affords, which will be as welcome to us, as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent this will be to you; If you intend correſpondency, be as diligent to take opportunity, as is</p>
